    "One interesting thing I noticed that is happening is with quicksort_first. From the last test, we created an array of random numbers and sorted it. In this case, I took an already sorted list and just reversed the whole thing. Even when dealing with $n=10^6$, the algorithm would still work, even though it wasn't faster than quicksort_middle. But with the reverse array, quicksort_first has trouble just sorting an array of size $10^4$, which is significantly smaller than $10^6$. quicksort_last still has trouble going to $n=10^4$ or higher, similar to how it was from the last test. So based on this test, as well as the previous, quicksort_first seems better for $n=100$ or smaller and quicksort_middle is better as $n$ bets bigger and bigger."

With this value, I group the array into smaller arrays, with the length of each being this intger we found, and put the remaining elements in a smaller array. Then I took each mini array and shuffled the values and concatenated them together for a whole new array comprised of the same values as the original, which each group shuffled."
